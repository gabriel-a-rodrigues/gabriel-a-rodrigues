### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Campinas, in Brazil. Coding is one of my favourite activities and I'm interested in all things AI.

I'm currently working on a research project on inner alignment. I've been studying reinforcement learning, deep learning and AI safety.
